# Introduction

I like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) but I find how it syncs settings and plugins to be frustrating. I created this notebook to be a starter kit I could download from a central place that would give me an Obsidian notebook with settings and structure that I like. 

Read the [Obsidian Docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) for more information about how obsidian works.

# Setup

A few things need to be setup before you can use this notebook. 

## Install Atkinson Hyperlegible Font (Optional)
Before opening this notebook in Obsidian, download and install the font: https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont.

## AI Commander API Key
You need an OpenAI API key. You can generate one here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. I have set the model to ChatGPT-4, this might be too expensive for your tastes. You can select a different model from here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/continuous-model-upgrades. 

## Omnivore.app API Key
Go to [Omnivore.app](https://omnivore.app) to create an account and get an API Key, and then set that key in the Omnivore settings

# Installed Plugins 

These plugins can be accessed using *command-p* or *ctrl-p* and then typing their names depending on your system.

## Wikipedia
Fetches Wikipedia Summaries. https://github.com/jmilldotdev/obsidian-wikipedia
> **Wikipedia** is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the use of the wiki-based editing system MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. It is consistently ranked as one of the ten most popular websites in the world, and as of 2024 is ranked the fifth most visited website on the Internet by Semrush. Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization that employs a staff of over 700 people.Initially only available in English, editions in other languages have been developed. Wikipedia's editions, when combined, comprise more than 62 million articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 14 million edits per month (about 5.2 edits per second on average)  as of November 2023. Roughly 26% of Wikipedia's traffic is from the United States, followed by Japan at 5.9%, the United Kingdom at 5.4%, Germany at 5%, Russia at 4.8%, and the remaining 54% split among other countries, according to data provided by Similarweb.Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, and culture. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism). While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward while becoming an important fact-checking site.Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.
